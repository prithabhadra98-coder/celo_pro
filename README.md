# 🎴 DeckChain – A Decentralized Smart Deck Manager (XYZ Project)

## 🧩 Project Description
**DeckChain** is a simple blockchain-based project built using **Solidity** for beginners learning how to create and interact with smart contracts.  
The idea of **XYZ** is to explore decentralized management of digital “cards” and “decks,” where users can **create**, **shuffle**, and **draw cards** securely on the Ethereum blockchain — all without relying on centralized servers.

This project demonstrates core blockchain principles:
- Ownership of digital assets  
- Data stored transparently on-chain  
- Deterministic execution through smart contracts

## 🚀 What It Does
DeckChain allows users to:
1. **Create cards** with custom names and metadata (like an image or JSON attributes).  
2. **Build decks** by selecting a<img width="1919" height="921" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-29 150541" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/027c431e-95d2-46e4-99cc-c3ac5b6d5b42" />
 combination of existing cards.  
3. **Shuffle decks** in a pseudo-random order.  
4. **Draw cards** one by one, just like in a physical card game.  
5. **Check remaining cards** in any deck.  

Perfect for learning how Solidity structures (`struct`, `mapping`, etc.) and smart-contract functions work in real-world scenarios.

## ✨ Features
- 🧱 **Card Creation** – Anyone can create unique digital cards stored on-chain.  
- 🔐 **Deck Ownership** – Each deck is owned by the wallet that created it.  
- 🎲 **On-Chain Shuffle** – Simple pseudo-random shuffle for demonstration (can be upgraded with Chainlink VRF).  
- 🃏 **Draw System** – Draw cards sequentially while the contract tracks progress.  
- 📜 **Transparency** – Every action (create, shuffle, draw) is public on the blockchain.
